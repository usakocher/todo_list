# To Do List
## Purpose
This app creates to-do items based on the user input and keeps a list. It has a delete button for each item that removes it, and a check item for completed tasks. The user can
also filter the visible list based on completion status.

## Process
This app uses React.js for the front end. It uses states and effects to change what a user sees and how an item renders.

## Future additions
Ultimately this would be ideal for communicating with third party systems and having some sort of integration with calendar APIs. Also adding the ability to email reminders
to users or even text.
